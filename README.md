# Vibecode AI Academy

This repository contains my notes, exercises, and practice tasks from the Vibecode AI Academy course on Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs).

## About this course
The course covers both theoretical and practical aspects of AI development, including:

- Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence and LLMs
- Working with popular AI tools and IDEs (Claude, Copilot, Cursor, Gemini)
- AI-assisted development workflows
- Backend and database integration with AI
- Advanced AI concepts like agents, testing, and documentation as code
- Building a complete AI-enabled project

The course spans multiple days, starting with foundational concepts and gradually progressing to independent project work, covering frontend and backend development, security, UX/UI, and deployment.

## Repository structure
- Each day of the course has its own folder (e.g., `Day 1 AI and LLM Fundamentals`) containing:
  - Lecture notes
  - Diagrams and screenshots
  - Exercises and practice tasks

## How to use
Browse the folders to follow the course content day by day. This repository serves as a learning journal and a portfolio of completed exercises.
