- Agent service properly configured
- Required permissions for agent operations

### Basic Agent Initialization
```php
// Initialize a specific agent
$codeAgent = app(CodeAnalysisAgent::class);
$testingAgent = app(TestingAgent::class);
$docAgent = app(DocumentationAgent::class);
$pmAgent = app(ProjectManagementAgent::class);
```

### Agent Configuration
```php
// Configure agent settings
$agent->setConfig([
    'analysis_depth' => 'comprehensive',
    'output_format' => 'detailed',
    'notification_enabled' => true,
    'auto_fix' => false
]);
```

## üìù Starter Prompts for Development Agents

### 1. Short Prompt (Quick Tasks)
```bash
# Fix validation mismatch between frontend and backend controllers
"Analyze the validation rules in AuthController and ensure they match the frontend form validation. Report any discrepancies and suggest fixes."

# Run full test suite and report failures
"Execute the complete test suite, identify failing tests, and provide a summary of issues with suggested fixes."

# Generate basic API documentation
"Generate comprehensive API documentation for all endpoints in the AuthController and ToolController."
```

### 2. Medium Prompt (Feature Development)
```bash
# Implement role-based access control improvements
"Review the current role system implementation, identify areas for improvement, implement enhanced permission checking, and update the frontend components to handle the new permission system. Include comprehensive testing."

# Optimize database queries and performance
"Analyze all database queries in the application, identify N+1 problems and slow queries, implement optimizations including eager loading and query caching, and provide performance benchmarks."

# Add comprehensive error handling
"Implement global error handling middleware, create custom exception classes for different error types, update frontend error handling, and add user-friendly error messages with proper logging."
```

### 3. Long Prompt (System Overhaul)
```bash
# Complete audit system implementation with advanced features
"Design and implement a comprehensive audit logging system that tracks all user actions, system changes, and API calls. Include:
- Database schema for audit logs
- Middleware for automatic logging
- Admin interface for viewing audit trails
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Export functionality for compliance
- Real-time audit notifications
- Performance optimization for large log volumes
- Automated log rotation and cleanup
- Integration with existing role system
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation and user guides"

# Implement advanced AI tool recommendation system
"Build an intelligent recommendation system for AI tools that includes:
- User behavior analysis and machine learning
- Collaborative filtering algorithms
- Content-based recommendations
- Real-time recommendation updates
- A/B testing framework for recommendation algorithms
- Admin dashboard for recommendation management
- User feedback integration
- Performance metrics and analytics
- Scalable architecture for large datasets
- API endpoints for recommendation data
- Frontend components for displaying recommendations
- Comprehensive documentation and testing"

# Develop comprehensive monitoring and alerting system
"Create a full-featured monitoring and alerting system that includes:
- Real-time application performance monitoring
- Database performance tracking
- User activity monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- System health checks
- Custom metric collection
- Dashboard for monitoring data visualization
- Configurable alert rules and thresholds
- Email, SMS, and webhook notifications
- Historical data storage and analysis
- Integration with external monitoring tools
- Automated incident response workflows
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Complete documentation and setup guides"
```

## üîß Agent Development Guidelines

### Creating Custom Agents
```php
<?php

namespace App\Services;

use App\Contracts\AgentInterface;

class CustomAgent implements AgentInterface
{
    protected $config = [];
    
    public function execute(string $prompt): array
    {
        // Implement agent logic here
        return [
            'status' => 'success',
            'results' => [],
            'recommendations' => []
        ];
    }
    
    public function setConfig(array $config): void
    {
        $this->config = array_merge($this->config, $config);
    }
}
```

### Agent Configuration
```php
// Register agent in AppServiceProvider
public function register()
{
    $this->app->singleton(CustomAgent::class, function ($app) {
        return new CustomAgent();
    });
}
```

### Agent Middleware
```php
// Create middleware for agent operations
class AgentMiddleware
{
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        // Check agent permissions
        if (!$this->hasAgentAccess($request->user())) {
            abort(403, 'Agent access denied');
        }
        
        return $next($request);
    }
}
```

## üìä Agent Monitoring & Analytics

### Agent Performance Tracking
```php
// Track agent execution metrics
$metrics = [
    'execution_time' => $executionTime,
    'memory_usage' => memory_get_peak_usage(),
    'success_rate' => $successRate,
    'error_count' => $errorCount
];
```

### Agent Logging
```php
// Comprehensive agent logging
Log::channel('agents')->info('Agent executed', [
    'agent_type' => $agentType,
    'user_id' => $userId,
    'prompt' => $prompt,
    'results' => $results,
    'execution_time' => $executionTime
]);
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Agent Access Control
- Role-based agent access permissions
- API key authentication for external agents
- Rate limiting for agent operations
- Audit logging for all agent activities

### Data Protection
- Sensitive data filtering in agent operations
- Encrypted communication between agents
- Secure storage of agent configurations
- Privacy-compliant data handling
